This code iterates through the Fibonacci sequence until the sum 
of the previous two numbers is greater than 4,000,000 and checks 
each time if the sum of the two is an even number. If this is true 
then they are added to ‘finalsum’ which will print the total at the 
end of the sequence. 

The most important part of the code is the line ‘x, y = y, x+y;’ which 
adds the two numbers together into ‘x’ and the previous number into ‘y’, 
essentially the Fibbonacci sequence in a single line.
